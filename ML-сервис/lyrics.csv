he got up outta there ran for hundreds of miles
high flying oh
the love he receives is the love that is saved
high wide oh
a wave came crashing like a fist to the jaw
alone in a corridor waiting locked out
well fuckers he still stands
and he still gets his love he just gives it away
he's flying whole
a bad time nothing could save him
a human being that was given to fly

are you getting something out of this all encompassing trip
seems that needlessly it's getting harder to find an approach and a way to live
a lesson to be applied

have you the belief that the road ahead ascends off into the light
checked your hands and studied the lines
are we getting something out of this all encompassing trip"

i can see it coming

his life for our freedoms

the sideways eye
father is risking
if you save yourself
how loud can silence get
in my child's eye
she's folding in darkness
the empty chair where dad sits
but it's becoming a lie
looks like lightning
begging for slumber
i can feel it coming
always giving her
the stars on her pillow
violently shakes
to an endless fall"

i love you anyway

sitting on the bottom rung
god forsaken never too late with my
i can do no
friends became my enemies
i hated everything
halo with me underneath
you'll never change
i'm complete
took advice from the wrong shoulder
took a lot of everything
born too young top of my lungs"
audioslave,"i want you to know
no regrets no remorse
to be where
i felt the world turning only for us
i chased you thru the midnight streets
and unlike the times before
where happiness lies
i've come to realize
more than man or machine
higher than any religion
more than fiction
and you burn brighter than most
i didn't care what tomorrow held
even when wrong we're right
i could speak freely
we have more than everything
rise up let life's kiss send us reeling
from yesterday comes tomorrow
we'll squeeze the blood out of life
far beyond the world of diamonds and gold
when life comes alive the past moves aside
only bliss now for you and me
no regrets and no remorse
and say goodnight to the silver of old
more than luck"

yeah whew ooh oh yeah

just an anchor on my heart
and kill everything you love
i need a little sympathy
where the moon is glued to a picture of heaven
i'm in the dark
beneath the riverbed
who isn't me
as desperate as you are
and if you live you can fall to pieces
crack a smile and cut your mouth
cause fear is strong and love's for everyone

we'll set ourselves apart in time

it's telling me what"
audioslave,"again on his face or roses
heard voices in his head
i came to realize
i saw him in the mirror and
i could understand
no one knows what they say
that looked a lot like me
innocence on a ball and chain
and when he turned away
who took his life too young
i had killed myself
in his hands but when he smiled
now his mothers dead
for things he hadn't done
if you're free you'll never see the walls
and a boy who's gone insane
if you're head is high you'll never fear at all
if you're right you'll never fear the wrong
then did just what he'd done
if you're head is clear you'll never freefall
she swore she'd never do the same

he'll never feel the sun
i shot him in the head"

i'm going to work the straw

behind a cigarette
i will sing no more
far from this opera forever more
a seven nation army couldn't hold me back
make the sweat drip out of every pore
they're gonna rip it off
and the stains coming from my blood tell me go back home
every single one's got a story to tell
i'm bleeding and
all the words are going to bleed from me
everyone knows about it

they were locked
it was a red car and it was new

it was daylight when you woke up in your ditch
i get an amen  baaaaaaaa

tomorrow is harvest day and to them it is the holocaust

feeds on life
your hands were sticky

 cricket sounds until 69 13 51 then
save our brothers
now red was your color and of course 
those little people out there were yours too
lord why did everything always have to keep changing like this
out across your field 
you could see two tiny people walking by your woods
i have seen the light
your head was almost empty
they have a consciousness they have a life they have a soul
and took me on high and higher still
until we moved to the spaces betwixt the air itself
your head hurt and it rang when you stood up
and the angel said unto me
satan must be our cousin
you got to your car and tried all the doors
you can see the car parked far down the road
and you walked toward it
let the rabbits wear glasses
one thousand nay a million voices full of fear
i sprang from my slumber drenched in sweat
like the tears of one million terrified brothers and roared
father  you thought 
 then
when you stood up there was goo all over your clothes
there was an expensive leather camera case laying on the seat
you began to walk towards them
lord 
what are these tortured screams
angel of the
you wiped them on your grass so now your color was green
and as we descended 
cries of impending doom rose from the soil
you crawled up out of your ditch
onto your gravel road and began to walk 
waiting for the rest of your mind to come back to you
and he brought me into a vast farmlands of our own midwest
you were already getting nervous again"

now the man of the hour is taking his final bow
he was guiding me love his own way
old men comprehend
the rusted signs left just for me
as the curtain comes down

a snowflake falls in may

the old man paved
father ruled by long division young men they pretend
the broken seams along the way
i feel that this is just goodbye for now
cause the man of the hour is taking his final bow"

each little wound
hard to swallow
buzzing around disease

to wash your garden away
so your trees wash away like veins

to see my love congeal
on your concertina that surrounds
mine to break your
you gave me fresh deadly roses
and your fresh deadly roses
i'm dry as stone
is getting harder to hide
of all the lonely
more thorns in my side
and leaves growing blood hungry leeches

take a blow and
soldiers you left battle torn
fresh deadly roses"

standing sitting kneeling

oh that which was once was once up to me
bugs in my shoes
they don't go nowhere
i join them
bugs in my bed
that's when
i'll become one
bugs on my ceiling
crowded the floor
waiting waiting
their eggs in my head
i kill them
i'll become naked and with them
i don't think they're that dumb
bugs in my ears
tickle my nausea
i got bugs on my skin
bugs in the way
they're always taking over
become their friend
and now the questions
i trick them
i'll just stop now
i see they surround me
bugs on my window trying to get in
now it's too late

my god its been so long
but now here you are and here
i just want to scream
i can't seem to place it
lifetimes are catching up with me
hearts and thoughts they fade
it's hard when your stuck upon the shelf
memories like fingerprints are slowly raising
me you wouldn't recall for
perhaps that's what no one wants to see
i'm not my former
all these changes taking place
hearts and thoughts they fade fade away  x3
small town predicts my fate
i'd seen the place but no one's ever taken me
haunting familiar yet
cannot find the candle of thought to light your name"
soundgarden,"i can't see why
just loves to give it away
i don't mind but the truth
i want to see
i'd ever want to
i want to be
you share but money can't give
and even if it isn't mine to say
what the truth takes away
i'll say it anyway
throw it away
i painted my mind
understand you
you gave yourself
but money can't give
but the ugly truth
if you were mine to give
don't look that good on me
i might throw it away
ugly isn't what"
pearl_jam,"i just want to be
i just need to say  
take a good look
this could be the day
hold my hand
lie beside me
i know that i would not ever touch you
hold you
feel you
ever hold
never again
i could have
heard your voice one last time 
this could be my time
how 'bout you 
would you hit me 
would you hit me 
and initiatives are taken up
by the middle
there ain't gonna be any middle any more
ain't indicative of my place
left the porch
left the porch

this could be the day
hold my hand
walk beside me
i just need to say
what can"

where the dogs are shitting
things aren't looking so good
i'm feeling that
it gives me butterflies
i'm feeling outshined

i'm sinking

i'd like to say
i can't get any lower
i just looked in the mirror
even though"

in a room full of emptiness
in dreams until my death
who will take me to heaven
and there you led me on
the sky was bruised
the wine was bled
i was lost in the pages
and if we're good we'll lay to rest
reading how we'll die alone
anywhere we want to go
of all the things
to the gods and the angels
for all that
i will wander on

i stil believe
and there's just one word
love is all you need  all you need is love
all you need is love
that when all is lost there will be you
questions rise and answers fall   insurmountable
and there's just one word that
take the reigns  steer us towards the clear
don't leave you alone
i know it's already been sung   can't be said enough
take the reigns and steer us towards the clear   here
let the games begin
constant recoil
cause to the universe
lost 9 friends we'll never know  2 years ago today
love   love love love love
i still believe and it's
and if our lives became too long would it add to our regret
once you hold the hand of love  it's all surmountable
trying to shake the cancer off
i don't mean a thing
first comes love then comes pain
the wisdom that the old can't give away
it's already been sung but it can't be said enough
stupid human beings"

and they're breakin' down the distance between right and wrong
for they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
who'll judge the many when the game is through
and time is a runnin' backwards and so is the bride
ring them bell from the sanctuaries 'cross the valleys and streams
ring them bells  for the time that flies
ring the bells from the fortress for the lilies that bloom
ring them bells  all those who are left
for the lines are long and the fighting is strong
ring them bells so the world will know that
and the mountain is filled with lost sheep
for the shepherd is asleep where the willow weep"

a chip off the corner stone
is nothing he concedes
something maybe two tone
it's nothing as it seems
whisper through a megaphone
anything of his own
a blanket like the ozone
the little that he frees is nothing he believes
putting in and putting in
the little that you see it's home
the little that he sees is nothing he conceives
a little bittersweet
all that he needs
a one way ticket headstone
the little that he sees"

took advice from the wrong shoulder
took a lot of everything
born too young top of my lungs"
audioslave,"i want you to know
no regrets no remorse
to be where
i felt the world turning only for us
i chased you thru the midnight streets
and unlike the times before
where happiness lies
i've come to realize
more than man or machine
higher than any religion
more than fiction
and you burn brighter than most
i didn't care what tomorrow held
even when wrong we're right
i could speak freely
we have more than everything
rise up let life's kiss send us reeling
from yesterday comes tomorrow
we'll squeeze the blood out of life
far beyond the world of diamonds and gold
when life comes alive the past moves aside
only bliss now for you and me
no regrets and no remorse
and say goodnight to the silver of old
more than luck"

i'm in the dark
beneath the riverbed
who isn't me
as desperate as you are

who took his life too young
i had killed myself
in his hands but when he smiled
now his mothers dead
for things he hadn't done
if you're free you'll never see the walls
and a boy who's gone insane
if you're head is high you'll never fear at all
if you're right you'll never fear the wrong

every single one's got a story to tell
i'm bleeding and

those little people out there were yours too
lord why did everything always have to keep changing like this
out across your field 
you could see two tiny people walking by your woods
i have seen the light
your head was almost empty
they have a consciousness they have a life they have a soul
and took me on high and higher still
until we moved to the spaces betwixt the air itself
your head hurt and it rang when you stood up
and the angel said unto me
satan must be our cousin
you got to your car and tried all the doors
you can see the car parked far down the road
and you walked toward it
let the rabbits wear glasses
one thousand nay a million voices full of fear
i sprang from my slumber drenched in sweat
like the tears of one million terrified brothers and roared
father  you thought 
 then
when you stood up there was goo all over your clothes
there was an expensive leather camera case laying on the seat
you began to walk towards them
lord 
what are these tortured screams
angel of the
you wiped them on your grass so now your color was green
and as we descended 
cries of impending doom rose from the soil
you crawled up out of your ditch
onto your gravel road and began to walk 
waiting for the rest of your mind to come back to you
and he brought me into a vast farmlands of our own midwest
you were already getting nervous again"

on your concertina that surrounds
mine to break your

let the games begin
constant recoil
cause to the universe
lost 9 friends we'll never know  2 years ago today

i still believe and it's

anything of his own
a blanket like the ozone

blame it all on chemical intercourse
breeding in the thoughts of ten

i heard the band start playing
it’s instilled to wanna live
like a ball that’s spinning
as the human tide rolls in
in our insignificance
please forgive our hometown
bombs dropping down
dancing in irreverence
so set up the ten pins
excuses turn to carbon walls
on the lip late take off
perfect lefts come rolling in
thousand fools who fight irrelevance
overhead underground

in the blood the iron lies"

screamin' sweat and bare feet to the floor
in my mind not forgotten
trying to make the words you can't ignore
buzzards cry when flesh is rippin'
in my eyes what

fai schifo  3
my heart beats too fast"
perfect_circle,"unable to find my way
drive another nail down another
high and surrendering to the gravity and the unknown
like a baby unable to stand on my own
i choose to live
broken and weary
dizzy and clearly unable to
help me survive the bottom
snare another pill and
i am surrendering to the gravity and the unknown
catch me heal me lift me back up to the sun
dizzy and clearly unable to just let this go
just let this go
tail in hand
needy hole please release me"
pearl_jam,"if he only knew now what he knew then
so this is what it's like to be an adult
dream up a new self for himself
he's alive but feels absolutely nothing
no tradebacks
he waits hoping for a presence something anything to enter
after spending half his life searching he still felt as blank as the ceiling at which he's staring
when he was six he believed that the moon overhead followed him by nine he had deciphered the illusion trading magic for fact"
pearl_jam,"others like it more when there's fire in the sky
i like every minute of the day
and so you see that
they say a suntan never fails
i know a crowd who only lives after midnight
the people on my hill they say
the pleasure seems to balance out the pain
i dig every second
i'm completely crazy
i was lucky to get a job and some pay
i even shun the south of
worship the sun when it's high
each precious moment has its special charm
i know a crowd who  or something
but when they sleep
their faces always seem so pale
get up early just to watch the sunrise
i sing and dance
i was a man who worked a night shift
and then there's friends of mine who must have sunlight
but when they sing
it's all right when you're around rain or shine
i get a buzz from being cold and wet
i could laugh in the snow and rain
so long as you are on my mind
cocktails in the blue red and grey
some people go for those sultry evenings"
nine_inch_nails,"i have never been there
i know what it feels like
 wet as it is  the whiter the honey
i have been inside you
i reject
 goodies come in here all day
i take a little piece of you
i can't remember
i reject
 now girl  only it's flavor  bow down here 
the taste of your sweat
the look in your eye
i reject
photographs
i have never had you
give me your reminder
i have got to have a memory
i took of you
well times
i passed through
so many faces
so many places"
tool,"we both want
you are broken now but faith can heal you
just do everything
christ why don't you come save my life now
what you need is someone strong to guide you
when he speaks
open my eyes and blind me with you light
trust in me now don't you judge or question
to rape you
i tell you to do
let me lay my holy hand up hand upon you
he speaks through me
he has needs"
perfect_circle,"one resolve
to release us all
one more medicated peaceful moment  give me
one more medicated peaceful moment
gotta cut away clear away
i don't wanna feel this overwhelming hostility
liberate this will
keeping me from killing you
gotta cut away clear away snip away and sever this umbilical residue
i don't wanna feel this world around me hostility

i can almost hear you scream
snip away inside of this umbilical residue
and from pulling you down with me"

pearl_jam,"this key to the locks on the chains he saw everywhere
arms wide open with the sea as his floor
deliver him wings
and sometimes is seen a strange spot in the sky
but first he was stripped and then he was stabbed by faceless men
he's flying oh
he got up outta there ran for hundreds of miles
high flying oh
the love he receives is the love that is saved
high wide oh
a wave came crashing like a fist to the jaw
alone in a corridor waiting locked out
well fuckers he still stands
and he still gets his love he just gives it away
he's flying whole
a bad time nothing could save him
a human being that was given to fly
i'm flying oh
he made it to the ocean had a smoke in a tree
the wind rose up set him down on his knee
oh power oh
hey look at me now"

if you love someone tell 'em
i don't give a fuck
i don't want to see this no more
i'll kick the fuck out of you
let the words that you say to me
that time has come and gone now it's just me
the world will spin
unless the actions sustain it
shower the people you love with love
we're meaningless
meaningless  we're not meaningless
we're not invisible  we're not meaningless
show them the way that you feel
it's meaningless
just me  this means nothin' no more

pearl_jam,"leaning out to catch the sun's rays
are you getting something out of this all encompassing trip
seems that needlessly it's getting harder to find an approach and a way to live
a lesson to be applied
makes much more sense to live in the present tense
makes more sense to live in the present tense
have you the belief that the road ahead ascends off into the light
checked your hands and studied the lines
are we getting something out of this all encompassing trip"
pearl_jam,"darling you'll save me
i can see it coming
and everyone else
his life for our freedoms
to contain him
war on her face
and mom she reassures
before the ground it gives way
she can feel this
the sideways eye
father is risking
if you save yourself
how loud can silence get
in my child's eye
she's folding in darkness
the empty chair where dad sits
but it's becoming a lie
looks like lightning
begging for slumber
i can feel it coming
always giving her
the stars on her pillow
violently shakes
to an endless fall"
pearl_jam,"and my hope in an alley way
and my world is never the same
i love you anyway
this is my staff this is my day
you don't have to run and hide away
there may be no tomorrow no
and my time is standing free
this is my chance this is my voice"

i can't remember"
audioslave,"right or wrong never too strong
i can do no wrong
i've decided to make it alright with my
low and high just one more time
by the age of seventeen
felt like an eternity
sitting on the bottom rung
god forsaken never too late with my
i can do no
friends became my enemies
i hated everything
halo with me underneath
you'll never change
i'm complete
took advice from the wrong shoulder
took a lot of everything
born too young top of my lungs"
audioslave,"i want you to know
no regrets no remorse
to be where
i felt the world turning only for us
i chased you thru the midnight streets
and unlike the times before
where happiness lies
i've come to realize
more than man or machine
higher than any religion
more than fiction
and you burn brighter than most
i didn't care what tomorrow held
even when wrong we're right
i could speak freely
we have more than everything
rise up let life's kiss send us reeling
from yesterday comes tomorrow
we'll squeeze the blood out of life
far beyond the world of diamonds and gold
when life comes alive the past moves aside
only bliss now for you and me
no regrets and no remorse
and say goodnight to the silver of old
more than luck"
pearl_jam,"i got a feeling
yeah whew ooh oh yeah
i won't be late again no no no

who took his life too young
i had killed myself
in his hands but when he smiled
now his mothers dead
for things he hadn't done

i'm bleeding and

your head was almost empty
they have a consciousness they have a life they have a soul

your head hurt and it rang when you stood up
and the angel said unto me
satan must be our cousin
you got to your car and tried all the doors
you can see the car parked far down the road
and you walked toward it
let the rabbits wear glasses
one thousand nay a million voices full of fear
i sprang from my slumber drenched in sweat
like the tears of one million terrified brothers and roared

 then
when you stood up there was goo all over your clothes
there was an expensive leather camera case laying on the seat
you began to walk towards them
lord 
what are these tortured screams
angel of the

and as we descended 
cries of impending doom rose from the soil

onto your gravel road and began to walk

the lord took her away from me

we hadn't driven very far
i can see my baby when
i swerved to the right
i lost my love my life that night
i found my baby that night
something warm falling into my eyes
i heard last
i had missed
but now she's gone
even though
but some how
i leave this world
oooooo oooooooooo
ooooooooooooo
i'll leave this world

i lifted her head
she looked at me and said
i'll never forget the sound that night
painfull scream that
hold me darling just alittle while
there were people standing all around
i held her close
there in the road
a car was stalled the engine was dead
i found the love"

this is my last exit
this is   x5
for better or for worse a best we began

won't ever find me here
i will give you what you're not supposed to have
i swear by sin
four days and not much longer
i'm like a tab

i was not received
i will land
and in your final hours
you better thing again
before my role defines you
built with stolen parts
moving right along
show me how to live
nail in my hand
on the quiet earth

you thought you made a man
to put my mind to bed

let the stains remind you
and roll out of my skin"

halfway there why would you turn around 
why invite it to stay 
yes comfort is an energy

blinded by choices hypocrites
your little piece of the divine

to see my love congeal
on your concertina that surrounds
mine to break your
you gave me fresh deadly roses
and your fresh deadly roses
i'm dry as stone
is getting harder to hide
of all the lonely
more thorns in my side
and leaves growing blood hungry leeches

you cut their pride
with fresh deadly roses
take a blow and
soldiers you left battle torn
fresh deadly roses"

bugs in my shoes

i'll become one
bugs on my ceiling
crowded the floor
waiting waiting
their eggs in my head
i kill them
i'll become naked and with them
i don't think they're that dumb
bugs in my ears
tickle my nausea
i got bugs on my skin
bugs in the way
they're always taking over

your greed self importance and your elegance
we've come to intervene
when it came down from the sky
and what you seem to value most

up to us to decide
i don't want your attention ' or so you used to say
or we will wipe this place clean
they were expecting us
you either change the way you've been doing things"

with a graveyard tan carrying a cross
so descretely
like never before
i've held sacred that
i like colorful clothing in the sun
i like playing in the sand what's mine is ours
i've loved the things that
i've dropped
i won't lie no more you can bet
cause it doesn't remind me of anything
calm and sleeping
i ilke hammering nails and speaking in tongues

i don't want to learn what
we won't stir up the past
the things that"

as my castle crumbles with time
i'll never know
that was your heart
i choose  to stroll amongst the waste

i live tomorrow you
you opened fire  and your mark was true
lost in the dark
such a crime
i'll not follow

how far to go
to reach that place
you opened fire"

there was a plan for them to be

over moral ground
claiming 'killing in god's name'
being sucked straight out to sea

healthy or insane
to be yourself is all that you can do
in a chapel yard
down inside their selfish brain
white roses on a grave
someone gets excited
another runs away
separate or united

spinning in the silence
someone kills the pain
with every single memory of the good or bad faces of luck
don't lose any sleep tonight
untill the end of time
to finally drift away
someone swears his true love
another lays a dozen
someone tries to hide himself
and another only fame

shipwreck from a love that he calls home
one light on
a song only he hears
all the strengths you might think would
disappear resolving
makes me shake
forevermore

better to jump than hesitate
i lost before you know
i go to sleep
i understand
i was so young too blind to see
don't say the words you might regret
there was a girl
i lie awake with great ideas
i tell myself before

can't remember what they said to me
i don't want to be all alone when i tell this story
i can't remember what they said to me
like the time that he floated away
a dead head chemistry bladder problems won't stifle me
i don't even know where to begin
a message of hope for those who choose to hear it
so they took me by the hand and invited me right in
brain dead can't remember what they said
my daily chore
but i forgot my pen shit the bed again
don't even know what that means must remember to write it down
with somniferous almond eyes
god damn shit the bed
the details of our ending
like i woke up in wonderland
right on my birkenstocks in the open
cause this shit never happens to me
such a heavy burden now to be the one
code red i'll put us in a diamond setting
the one who will deliver the message
and can anyone tell me why  indiscernable
d'd an air pollutant  indiscernable  area 51
someone hovered above my buckeyes
like an apparition he had me crying out
also a bit terrifying
holy fucking shit  holy fucking shit
if you look at your appearance for a moment you can see
then they showed me something
eat a box of krispy kremes
feet cold and eyes red
sunkist and
can't remember what they said
another banana bourbon enema
as some kind of blue creature
 indiscernable
fuck me sodomy
contemplating the whole truth
me the chosen one  they chose me
sudafed gyroscopes and infrared won't help
maybe i'll run over the upper lip but all i could think was
 indiscernable  fucking cats
see my heart is pounding
if i can't make it people who are watching see
can't breathe right now it was so real
see my heart is racing
strapped down to my bed
i'm out of my head
to write it down for all the world to see
and a warning for those who do not
shit better
you better listen
he revealed to me a singular purpose he said you are the chosen one
this is so real
this is so real finally it's my lucky day
of people thinking we just took a flaming
made out to be a hero
stale banana split the sky light well
one opened up we'd expect to see a place like this
see they're telling true and  and this wasn't all in my head"

what the truth takes away

heard your voice one last time 
this could be my time

take the reigns and steer us towards the clear   here
let the games begin
constant recoil
cause to the universe
lost 9 friends we'll never know  2 years ago today

i still believe and it's
and if our lives became too long would it add to our regret
once you hold the hand of love  it's all surmountable

a chip off the corner stone
is nothing he concedes
something maybe two tone
it's nothing as it seems
whisper through a megaphone
anything of his own
a blanket like the ozone
the little that he frees is nothing he believes
putting in and putting in
the little that you see it's home
the little that he sees is nothing he conceives
a little bittersweet
all that he needs
a one way ticket headstone
the little that he sees"

i could see now
a thousand ways to make it true
don't want your dreams you try to sell
the temple walls are made of flesh
i get too tight
i'm on track"
soundgarden,"i love you love you
it's not your fault
i know it hurts
you have a good day
i left for work
it's not my fault"
pearl_jam,"glorified version of a
glorified version of a pellet gun feels so manly when armed
kindred to be an
ooh life comes
i can feel your heart in your neck
i can steal your heart from your neck
ok man 'cause"
tool,"you believed in me
you believed
fell at the hands of
didn't have a life
cause you you pray for me too
a patient in spirit
ends all lies
i wouldn't see
i to say to all these ghouls tonight
alright now it's time for us to let you go
difficult to see with this light
well might of told a lie
a light in your eyes that
without us in your heart
you believed in moments not conceived
but surely saved one
those moments that
she never told a lie
vacant broken
daylight dims leaving cold fluorescence
uncompromise
please forgive this selfish question but
i done to be a son to an angel
i done to be worthy
but never lived one"
pearl_jam,"lot to be said for nowhere
we've disappeared
want to be everywhere there's a
wheel will be turning right then straight
she's out on her own and line high
she's disappeared
side of the road spilled like wine now
off in the sunset she'll ride
she can remember a time denied stood by
fuck it we'll disappear
there's no leaving here"
perfect_circle,"i know that you can hear me
you're better off this way
  you're better off this
why can't you turn and face me
i tell you   show me  show me
you fucking disappoint me
it's your right and your ability
maybe you're better off
from what the doctor tells me
i'll say you're vacant
and maybe you're better off this way
cold and catatonic
i'm sure of your ability
to become my perfect enemy
rise up and show me
someday
go ahead and play dead
i know that you can hear this
people better off this way
i'll say you're vacant
and maybe you're better off this way
my perfect enemy
rise up and show me
i catch a brief reflection
of what you could and might have been
rise up  why can't you /
i just can't believe him
prefer the optimistic  one"
pearl_jam,"the one down here’s wearing thin
blame it all on chemical intercourse
breeding in the thoughts of ten
i was alone and far away
i heard the band start playing
it’s instilled to wanna live
like a ball that’s spinning
as the human tide rolls in
in our insignificance
please forgive our hometown
bombs dropping down
dancing in irreverence
so set up the ten pins
excuses turn to carbon walls
on the lip late take off
perfect lefts come rolling in
thousand fools who fight irrelevance
overhead underground
c 3 let the song protest
in the blood the iron lies"
alice_in_chains,"score at face a ten for slacking
smaller fish so huge the ocean
i'm lacking
scared to face the dyin' nothin'
behind the smile a tongue that's slippin'
it ain't like that anymore
things that cut and burn so often
screamin' sweat and bare feet to the floor
in my mind not forgotten
trying to make the words you can't ignore
buzzards cry when flesh is rippin'
in my eyes what
i'm feelin' sore
sign the deal set in motion
i've waited for
i fight is why
i'd not soften
feel as though a tooth were rotten
i sit think of somethin'
see the cycle"
pearl_jam,"hey hey oh  hey oh oh
i want is to drink please fuckin' leave me alone
i don't give a fuck
got this burnin' desire coming straight from my heart
i want is for you to make love to me
my back is broken my feet are hurtin'
suck you dry  suck  suck you dry  suck you dry
suck me dry  suck this dry
i want is to drink maybe with just one other person
i don't know nothin' at all
i just wanna live life and be dumb and happy like an
i'm a stupid fuck
i'll never be your beast of learning"
alice_in_chains,"before the real you lays to waste
i tried to own you
it would be so easy with a whore
i live for you but
my twisted passion to be your world
take my hand before
lying crying dying to leave
innocence creates my hell
try to understand me little girl
i'm not alive
i still burn
sweet little angel you should have run
i want to peel the skin from your face
still love you"
perfect_circle,"my spirit gets so downhearted sometimes
and where is the harmony
sweet harmony
i walked on
i ask myself
this wicked world
and who are the trusted
is there only pain and hatred and misery
there's one thing
through troubled times
i wanna know
searchin' for light in the darkness of insanity
what's so funny 'bout peace love & understanding
so where are the strong
is all hope lost"
soundgarden,"i know what you're gonna say
 unknown line
i ain't your only friend
that it's okay maybe now
 unknown line
when are you going to understand"
tool,"they make a club
right in two
silly monkeys give them thumbs
baffled and confused
how they survive so misguided is a mystery
plenty in this holy garden silly old monkeys
father blessed them all with reason
monkey killing monkey killing monkey
they forge a blade
fight over life over blood over prayer overhead and light
fight over love over sun over another
h patience and reason
angels on the sideline again
wondering when this tug of war will end
now they're all confused
father give these humans free will
wonders when you're bound to divide it
and this is what they choose 
 and this is what they choose
over pieces of the ground
and beat their brother down
puzzled and amused
eden has enough to go around
and brothers wonder
bound to divide it"
nine_inch_nails,"i will see you there
he flexed his muscles to keep his flock of sheep in line
he made a virus that would kill off all the swine
his perfect kingdom of killing suffering and pain
demands devotion atrocities done in his name
your god is dead and no one cares
drowning in his own hypocrisy
and if there is a hell
i will see you there
burning with your god in humility
will you die for this
i put inside of me
he's got the answers to ease my curiosity
he dreamed up a god and called it
christianity
your god is dead and no one cares
if there is a hell"
